Here is an application to make video streaming for the videos in your computer created with the MERN stack with typescript.

This app also has the optional use of a database, you decide if you want to use it or not.

This project is inspired by this article that explains how to make streaming of video like youtube with node js,
[link_to_the_article](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/build-react-video-streaming-app/).

If you see the article that explains the fundamentals to make streaming with node, so I decided to take it 1 step more away, adding a frontend made with react and the backend with node, the frontend only consumes the API of the backend and make some little things, for example, use react-router-dom to create a single page app, you can see a description with more detail in the repo of the frontend [here](https://github.com/SL0W-HAND/react-video-streaming) , the backend is written in typescript, so it needed to be compiled to javascript, and here is the full compiled version ready to use, also you can see de details in the [repository](https://github.com/SL0W-HAND/stream-express).

note: each repository has clear instructions to set up.

The entrance of the app is the login page in which we need to put the password that we set on the back-end.

Next, we can see is the home page with the videos provided for the back-end.
