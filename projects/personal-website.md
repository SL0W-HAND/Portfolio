If you are reading this, you are on my website, well let me introduce some features, first of all, the website is built using the Nextjs framework, so it's building in react and compiled to static HTML, which makes it have a great performance in terms of speed, and I use other special characteristics, that makes this website more interesting of what you think.

Let's start with the projects section, the first you see is one list with my best projects where each one is compiled to HTML from a markdown file, in the section the info for each card is taken from the corresponding markdown file, and when you click on it you're redirected to a render version of the markdown file to static HTML, the characteristic of convert MD files to HTML is very useful because they write in Markdown is easier and practice.

Another interesting thing is the contact form where you can put your message and send me one email, taths possible thanks to [EmailJs](https://www.emailjs.com/), which have easy integration with React and make the work easy.
