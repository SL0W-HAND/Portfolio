This project is my first approach to the Nextjs framework, which is a javascript framework for creating web pages with react, the main attraction that I find interesting is the ability to create static files from react code, an option that gives a very good performance to mention routes.

The structure of the page is a very basic one, it is a home that redirects to other sites, where the most interesting feature here is the rendering of static props brought from the page's api, these are used for the letters of each of the guitarists.

Dynamic pages in nexts js are somewhat peculiar since in a file whose name must be of the style [id] .js the template that will be used in all the pages is put, and whose most useful option is to use static paths that creates a static html file for each path, improving loading time.
